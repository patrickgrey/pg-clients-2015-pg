A good date to start a new website…

The old website helped me learn about responsive design and performance but it just didn’t DO much. I didn’t have goals for it other than being a place to display my previous work. Blogging was also a little clumsy to get online, deterring me from writing.

<!-- more -->

The purpose of my new site is to get more work by:

* raising my profile via (short, focussed) blogging and,

* using the site as a platform to demo the processes and technologies that are required for many of today’s web development tasks.

I will develop this site in public, iterating to add new features and blogging as I go, as long as minor things like work, life and beer don’t get in the way.

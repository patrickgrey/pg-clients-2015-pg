A good date to start a new website…

I'm redesigning my site to try and find a wider variety of client work.

My old website helped me practice responsive design but it just didn't DO much. I didn’t have goals for it other than being a place to display my previous work. Blogging was also a little clumsy to get online, which deterred me from writing.

<!-- more -->

Current client work doesn't always allow me to progress into areas that interest me.

Therefore, I aim for the new site to:

* raise my profile with more frequent, focussed writing and,

* act as a platform to demo what I have been working on in web development.

I'll develop this site in public, iterating to add new features, trying out new technologies, designs and processes, and blogging as I go -  as long as minor things like paying work, life and beer don’t get in the way.

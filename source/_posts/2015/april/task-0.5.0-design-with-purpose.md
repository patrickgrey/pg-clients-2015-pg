* I want a clear and easy to read site.

* I want good contrast for accessibility reasons.

* It must be easy to navigate, see what is available and find items quickly.

From these points I started looking at styles I thought would be appropriate. I’ve always loved Americana, American Sign Writing, Vintage Railway posters, film noir and Soviet propaganda art. Might be interesting to try and mix them...

This [book/documentary about American Hand Sign Painting is a favourite of mine: Sign Painters by Faythe Levine & Sam Macon](http://www.signpaintersfilm.com/).

Unfortunately, I think this is close current ‘hipster’ / ‘vintage’ styles that have been popular for a while and I suspect are on the way out.

If I go for this look now it could seem like I am attempting to jump on a bandwagon that is disappearing over the horizon! Well, that sounds exactly like my sense of fashion, as anyone who has seen it will tell you: I’ve nailed permanently untrendy!

Therefore, I’m going to go with a style that reflects a bit of mine and will allow me to meet the purpose of the site!

Yee haawwww.
